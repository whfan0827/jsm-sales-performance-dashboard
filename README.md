- `Issue key` - Jira issue identifier
- `Issue id` - Issue ID
- `Summary` - Issue description

### Optional Columns
- `Custom field (MMPJ_MCI_PS)` - Presales personnel (supports multiple values and columns)

- `Custom field (MMPJ_MCI_TS)` - Technical Support personnel (supports multiple values and columns)
  - Also reads: TS1, TS2 (3 columns total with deduplication)

See `sample.csv` for a complete example.

## 🎨 Status Classification

The dashboard automatically classifies Jira Service Management statuses into three categories:

- **ToDo** (Yellow): Status starting with 0, 1, 2, or "To Do"
- **InProgress** (Blue): Status starting with 3-9
- **Done** (Red): Status is "Done"

## 👥 Multi-Personnel Support

The dashboard supports multiple personnel assignments for Presales and Technical Support:

- **Sales**: Single assignment per case
- **Presales**: Supports multiple personnel per case across 5 columns (PS, PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4)
  - Cases are counted for each assigned person
  - Automatic deduplication if same person appears in multiple columns
- **Technical Support**: Supports multiple personnel per case across 3 columns (TS, TS1, TS2)
  - Cases are counted for each assigned person
  - Automatic deduplication if same person appears in multiple columns

This allows accurate workload tracking when multiple team members collaborate on the same case.
